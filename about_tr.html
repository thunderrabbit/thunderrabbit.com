[The Rabbit happily scamper-bounces up to greet you.]

<p>
HI!  I'm Thunder Rabbit!  How are you today?  Welcome to my Burrow! Actually, my Burrow is down underneath this Giant Carrot
which Scout Seven and I made!  Actually he made it and we both converted it into a *real* Carrot!

<p>
[Thunder Rabbit pats the side of the Carrot gently, like a huge orange whale floating on a mysterious sea of whiteness.  You
look down at the fog wisping over your ankles and over Thunder's big fuzzy feet.]

<p>
Oh- be sure you don't sink into the cloud!

<p>
[Before you can finish thinking "what??," Thunder interjects.]

<p>
Yep!  A cloud!  We are standing on the top of a cloud floating miles above the grand city of Destria!

<p>
C'mon inside, and I'll tell you all about it!

<p>
[You follow Thunder as he steps down into the entrance to his Burrow underneath the Giant Carrot.  You are amazed at how the
cloud retains its shape, even down this circular staircase!  <br>

Once your eyes get adjusted to the light, you find yourself in what must be the living room of Thunder Rabbit's Burrow. (And you
thought the staircase was amazing...)]

<p>
Please have a seat!

<p>
[Thunder jumps over the coffee table to the recliner across from your extra comfy chair.  The gentle comforting warmth perfectly
contours itself around your body; it feels like you're sitting on a cloud!]

<p>
We've had the most extraordinary time lately.  Scout Seven and I were enhancing the laser I had built out of a tin can and piece
of grass, when the thing went off and blasted a hole in the side of my Burrow!<br> Can you believe that??<br>

[Thunder points toward a hole above and to the left of a picture of his Great GrandRabbit.]

<p>
Oh, you don't think I could build a laser out of a tin can and pices of grass??
Let me <a href="build_laser.html">tell you</a> about it!

<p>
<!--
I'm sure you noticed the Giant Carrot underneath which my Burrow is built.  The soft springy texture of the ground outside and
here inside the Burrow and your chair and my chair and the couch is due to the fact that this whole place is built within a
cloud!  It's amazing, I know.<br>

Here's how the <a href="build_burrow.html">Burrow</a> got started.

<!-- [with that, Thunder Rabbit scampers across the Courtyard.] -->
