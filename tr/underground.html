<p>
"I'll go get our gear!" announced Thunder, already halfway down the
hill.  He <em>almost</em> tripped while leaping over a large boulder,
but recovered before dashing himself and their future on the rocks.
"Where did we leave our stuff?"  Past the monolith he ran as he let his
subconscious guide him to their equipment.  Soon he found himself
picking through their gear beneath the largest oak in the forest.  "What
does one take on a journey into another world?"  He grabbed their food,
topped off his canteen with Scout's, grabbed the larger blanket, and
Scout's staff, and he scampered back toward The Ground.
<p>
Scout climbed down onto the tile, which had opened enough to allow him
to peer into the mind numbing pitch darkness.  He literally saw nothing.
<p>
Scout pulled his flashlight out of his pocket and aimed it into the
blackness, revealing more nothing.  He twisted the flashlight toward his
face to make sure it was working.  It was.  
<p>
"Hello?" called Scout down into the hole.  He was answered with a firm
grip on his right arm and leg, which yanked him unexpected into the
void.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Thunder pushed himself to run up the last few yards to The Ground.
"What's in it?" he panted, dropping the stuff near the tile.  "Scout?"
<p>
"Thunder!  I'm inside."
<p>
Thunder pushed their stuff onto the tile, and watched as it suddenly
leaped into the gap, as a leaf in a torrent of water down a drain.
<p>
"Something pulled me in here and I can't see anything except the 
faint light from outside."
<p>
"What pulled you in?" Thunder shouted.  "Do you have our stuff?"  
<p>
Thunder was a bit spooked having seen the stuff disappear.
<p>
"I don't know.  I can't feel anything."  Scout paused.  "Thunder,
there is about 1 more minute before that tile closes and I can't get
out."
<p>
Thunder stepped down onto the tile.  "Can you reach my arm if
I...yikes!"  Thunder was yanked by the ankles into the gap, as if he had
just slipped uncontrolled down a muddy hill.
<p>
"Thunder?"
<p>
"Scout?  Where are you? .. Where are we?"
<p>
"I don't know exactly."
<p>
They could do nothing but watch the thinning blue crack between the
tiles, which flashed white then disappeared as the umbra whisked by.
<p>
Total darkness.  Total silence.  Total nothing.  
<p>
Nothing to push against, step on, or squirm through.  Thunder kicked
wildly with his powerful legs, but felt nothing.
<p>
They were suspended in space and time.
<p>
After deciding struggle was useless, Thunder rested for a moment, then
began humming "Comfortably Numb."  After realizing he had repeated one
section three times, he stopped.  "Scout?"
<p>
"Yeah?"
<p>
"This is boring."
<p>
"Yeah- I enjoyed listening to you thrash around better."
<p>
"Don't you like my humming?"
<p>
"Why don't you try 'Goodbye Blue Sky'?"
<p>
"Very funny."
<p>
They sat there a few moments, wishing they had a choice.  Suddenly, they
could faintly hear music.
<p>
"Is that you?" they both asked.
<p>
Eventually the sound got louder and Thunder recognized it first.
<p>
"What the hell??  That's 'Eclipse'"
<p>
"We knew it was an eclipse.  What are you talking about?"
<p>
"No, Scout, that's the name of the song we hear."
<p>
"One slip and down the hole we fall." came a voice from nowhere.
<p>
Thunder nearly wet his pants.  "Who said that??"
<p>
"I'm Jack Dracula.  Your DJ for this eternity.  Watch your eyes."
