<p>They turned imperceptibly slowly.  Yet their precision gave away
the motion.  One had to admit that a moment ago, the teeth on any
particular gear hadn't been quite that close (or that far) apart.
They were definitely moving. But the motion was so precise; slow
smooth, as to be silent.Utterly perfect in each instant.</p>

<p>Yet, there was something else; by <em>definition</em> these gears
moved with perfection; they were The Gears that drove time.
Detecting anything other than perfection from these gears was,
literally, impossible.</p>

<p>"It's like the speed of light, it's an absolute that cannot be
broken," offered Scout.  "There are ways literally <em>around</em>
the limit, but one cannot break the limit.  It is absolute."</p>

<p>And so it was with the gears.  Absolute.  They moved in their
apparent vacuum chamber, absolved from any conteact from the outer
world, save the time filaments attached to the pistons they drove.</p>

<p>"It's said that this gear make a revolution once in about the time
it takes a large galaxy to rotate."</p>

<p>"Scout," Thunder ignored Scout's comment, "how id you get to earth?"</p>

<p>Thunder had seen Scout's ship, heknew in what vehicle Scout came
to earth, but he didn't know by what method Scout had bypassed the
pesky speed of light limit.</p>

<p>"I used the Dekroznian  Bypass to get to your galaxy and then
queried for a wormhole into your sector.  </p>

<p>"Scout," Thunder ignored Scout's answer, "did you go fastr than light?"</p>

<p>Nope.  Well, I arrived before the light that  left my star and did
not use the bypass I used.  But , no, I didn't go <em>faster</em>
than light."</p>

<p>"So that means there's a way to measure these gears.  There's *got*
to be a way around it; not tomeasure them directly, but some sort of
worm hole or a gear hole or something."</p>

<p>"Well," Scout considred for a moment.  "There probably is a way to
measure them, as you say, but" Scout thought for an even longer time.
"<em>Why</em> would you want to measure them?"</p>

<p>"Scout."  Thunder was surprised at Scout's query, but sometimes the
alien could be a bit obtuse. "because it would be <em>cool</em>."</p>

<p>Scout nodded agreeingly. "You're right about that. C'mon; let's go
get some food."</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>"So what's the deal with wormholes?  How do they work?"</p>


<p>"Well, I don't know <em>how</em> they work, just that they
"connect" two points in space.  The latest technology involves
synchronizing the vibrations of the actual ship *and in habitants) so
that it can pass through physical boundaries.  It all sorrta holds
itself together and just works.  I don'tknow really."  He added, "sorry."</p>

<p>"Hmfph.  What kind of alien are you, anyway,  You can calcuate the
exact time our earth will sop spinning, but you can't tell me how
wormholes work?"</p>

<p>"Nope.  I guess I'm just not good enough.  I'll go sit in the
corner until I understand wormholes."</p>

<p>Had it been a month after they first met, Thunder wouldn't have
been surprised if Scout had done literally that.  But by now Scout
had learned how to be sarcastic</p>
