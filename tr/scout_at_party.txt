	"Why don't you try 'Goodbye Blue Sky'?"

	Scout whirled his head, seeking the source of the sound.

	"I'm Jack Dracula.  Your DJ for this eternity.  Watch your eyes."




	Light intensity increased infinitely as gravity returned.  Sensors

screamed as Scout sought a recognizable framework to recalibrate his

instrumentation.  In order to calculate the intensity and direction of the 

local gravitational pull, he focused on a bright red shoe traveling through 

a parabolic curve toward a stationary object near him.  Scout had calculated 

the local gravity to seven decimal places before colliding with an unexpected 

soft leather couch.

	Scout spent 3/8ths of a second fine-tuning his sensors, adjusting for

changing light intesity, 

Thunder seemed stunned, staring after the shoe which had lept from the couch


during which

time he recognized several different languages being spoken
