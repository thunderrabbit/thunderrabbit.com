<h1 align=center>Millenium Party</h1>

<p>Thunder Rabbit quickly closed his eyes and wondered why he could no
longer see the crescented sun, and further wondered why he hadn't
noticed previously that he could no longer see it.</p>

<p>Scout Seven chuckled to himself at the phrase "watch your eyes,"
wondering how he could actually watch his own eyes.  He winced his
eyes shut as the brilliance exploded around them.</p>

<p>Thunder could see red light through his eyelids; Scout wondered why
he couldn't see anything at all.  They both suddenly felt themselves
falling.</p>

<p>Scout crashed onto a chandelier, which sent it swinging wildly
before it dumped him off sideways.  He fell amid small pieces of glass
and plaster onto an impossibly long table, landing squarely on a roast
chicken that had been hacked to pieces.  Some glasses spilled.  The
arm of the ice statue that had been slowly melting broke off with a
thunk then shattered on the floor.  Scout had hardly time to think
before the entire table collapsed under his weight.</p>

<p>The remaining glasses, full and otherwise, of wine and other
beverages, that hadn't previously spilled, now did so with abandon.
Some even lept from the table.  One ran toward the kitchen, presuming
it would be safe there.</p>

<p>Scout shook his head clear, looked up at the chandelier to make
sure it seemed content to remain attached to the ceiling.  Though
damaged, it appeared to have settled to a gentle swing.  He looked
around to see who may have been disturbed by his entrance, but no one
save the glasses and statue seemed to have noticed.</p>

<p>He tried to get up, and promptly put one hand in a bowl of horse
radish.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, not too far away, but facing the other direction,
Thunder landed with a soft whoofing sound on a big overstuffed couch.
Noting that the great falling sensation had stopped and the horrible
crashing noises had subsided, he slowly opened his eyes, delighted by
the sights around him.</p>

<p>Two bright red shoes chased each other over the couch.  Thunder
watched amazed as they went by, wondering if they were being worn by
some invisible being, or if they were themselves sentient, and further
wondered which of these options would be more amazing.  He decided on
the latter, and then was amazed that an invisible being could be so
light as to not make big dents on the couch with each step.  Upon
further reflection, he realized he had no idea how heavy invisible
beings were.</p>

<p>"Are those shoes <em>real</em>?" he found himself asking no one in
particular.</p>

<p>"Oh yes they're very real!  If you step on one, the other will
kick, so you better be careful."</p>

<p>He looked up at a woman whose outfit could have been complimented
by the shoes, except that she was wearing some .  She smiled brightly
down on the Rabbit, which made him both excited and a bit nervous; he
couldn't tell if she was genuinely pleased to see him, or if she was a
bit crazy.</p>

<p>"Um, hi.  What are you, er what are we doing here?"</p>

<p>"We're celebrating the Millenium!" she said with eyes bright and
happy.  Thunder relaxed a bit; he decided she meant no harm.</p>

<p>He shook his head a bit. "Wait, What?  The Millenium was .. 4 and a
half years ago!"</p>

<p>"No, silly! We're <em>celebrating <b>The Millenium</b>!</em>"</p>

<p>Thunder let it go.  He couldn't tell if she was making no sense, or
if he was just entranced by her smile. "Um, Wow!  That sounds great!
Do you mind if we hang out for a couple hours?"</p>

<p>"You can stay as long as you want!  When did you get here,
anyway?  I don't think I've met you before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I, sorry, Hi, I'm Thunder Rabbit."</p>

<p>"HI, Thunder Rabbit.  My name is Donna.  So when did you get
here?"</p>

<p>"Um, well, I think we got here only a moment ago, but I don't
really know <em>how</em> we got here.  Well, I know <b>how</b> but I
don't know <em>why</em> we got here.  Well, I know why.  We were
surprised to see a crack in The Ground, but I don't really know what
actually happened." Thunder wondered why in fact he was so confused
about this.</p>

<p>"Okay, what happened was Scout and I were playing Obstacle Chess
and we, well, he... he found this hole in The Ground.  Well it was a
crack when he found it... do you know Scout Seven?" </p>

<p>He looked back up and she was gone.</p>

<p>- - - -</p>

<p>Scout pulled his hand out of the horse radish, gave it a few
shakes to sling the slop onto the table.  He looked for a napkin to
wipe the dampness and ended up using the tablecloth itself.</p>

<p>"What's the use of throwing a party for just a few days?  These
people think on such small scales."  A man walking up to Scout wasted
no time on formalities. "I hear you're a traveler; would you like me
to host a party at your house after this one is, ah, finished?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd <em>like</em> that, but I'm sure you'd have difficulty
doing it.  I had to find a new planet; my star novaed 7 years
ago."</p>

<p>"Pity."</p>

<p>"I'm Scout Seven; I'm sorry about the table, I can fix it with -"</p>

<p>"We've got plenty.  The waitstaff will be cleaning it up shortly,
anyway.  So your star went and blew itself up.  I guess that's a good
way to clean up a mess of a planet.  We could use a nova or two around
here."</p>

<p>"Er, they're really not that fun.  Beautiful from a distance,
b-"</p>

<p>"But hot enough to roast a rabbit in a trice, I'm sure.  What *is*
that creature you came here with, anyway?"</p>

<p>"That's Thunder Rabbit; he's the one who taught me the language
here and has been my only companion for years.  I don't know what he
is, exactly, but he's harmless.  Well, he means no harm to
anyone."</p>

<p>"Yes.  Anyway, shall we have another party at your house?  Oh, yes,
your star.  Are you sure the planet has been destroyed?  What with
time looping fields, it could be well preserved and perfect for a
party soon."  Jack considered the possibilities.</p>

<p>"Anyway, these people have such small attention spans; they
wouldn't know a good party if I told them it was a great party.
Except for this one; it seems to have turned out rather well so far.
Where did you say you were from?"</p>

<p>"Eta Carinae."  Scout wondered if it mattered what he said this
time.</p>
