<p>"Have you heard from Thunder in a while?"</p>

<p>"Nope; last I heard he was in Asia.  Probably getting himself into
trouble again."  Scout laughed to himself.  "Remember that time he
decided he would convince everyone in Japan to stop being so reserved
all the time?"</p>

<p>"Heh. Yeah.  He dreams big dreams."</p>

<p>"I was actually just considering ways to bring him back. I don't
know if it would work or even how it could <em>possibly</em> work, but
I wonder if building a huge carrot statue could somehow bring him back
home."</p>

<p>"Even if it didn't work, it would certainly be a... a novelty."</p>

<p>"I think I'll do it."</p>
