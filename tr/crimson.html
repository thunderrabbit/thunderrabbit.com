<p>"Scout! look out behind you!"</p>

<p>Scout turned, but saw nothing, for he had already been struck in
the head by the falling log.  Thunder ran over to see if his friend
was okay.</p>

<p>"Scout?  Scout!"</p>

<p>He wasn't moving, wasn't responding.  It looked as if he had eaten
dirt, literally.</p>

<p>"Man, this isn't funny.  If you're messing with me please stop,
man.  Scout!"</p>

<p>Scout had never taken a joke this far; Thunder guessed he wasn't
joking.  <em>What to do?  Should I try to move him?  He's alive,
right?  Yes; he's breathing</em> but softly.  He just didn't seem to
be doing anything else.</p>

<p>Thunder wondered what was the best course of action in this
situation.  What did aliens need to recover from logs to the head?
Perhaps this was just a temporary condition; Scout would recover on
his own.  <em>Man, why hadn't we talked about this before?</em>
Thunder thought to himself.</p>

<p>He decided to clean Scout's face a bit; there was dirt smashed into
his mouth; some blood was coming from somewhere; it was only a couple
CCs and didn't seem to be gushing.  Thunder splashed water from his
canteen onto his towel and swept away the larger bits of dirt.  He
dabbed around Scout's lips to clean up the blood.</p>

<p>Scout moaned a bit.  A sort of pained noise, but nonetheless a joy
for Thunder to hear.</p>

<p>"time is it?"</p>

<p>"Scout?  It's 3 o'clock.  Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"3."</p>

<p>Thunder, relieved, wiped a bit less cautiously; his friend seemed
to be recovering.</p>

<p>"wa ter?"</p>

<p>"Here."  Thunder drizzled a bit from his canteen into Scout's
mouth.</p>

<p>Scout swallowed a small amount.  "What time, is it?"</p>

<p>"It's still 3 o'clock."</p>

<p>"mm.  what happened?"</p>

<p>"Heh.  Um, our little experiment didn't work as planned.  The log
came swinging down before you were ready and schnockered you pretty
hard.  You were out cold for a few minutes."</p>

<p>"experiment.  Is it 5 o'clock?"</p>

<p>"No; it's 3 o'clock.  Three oh six now.  Why?  What happens at 5?"</p>

<p>"have to go home."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Scout got a far away look in his eyes that Thunder hadn't
previously seen.  This was a bit different than a
distracted-in-thought look or simple daydreaming.  This was more like
Scout's entire Self had left his body in search of something; maybe it
had been knocked free by the log.  Maybe it was nothing; Thunder
didn't worry about it.</p>

<p>"Here.  Let's get you cleaned up."</p>

<p>Thunder got up and held out his paw to help Scout up.  Scout
obliged, but didn't seem fully aware.  He got up carefully, but with
minimal difficulty and followed Thunder toward the river.</p>

<p>The river was a bit large to be called a creek, but really it
wasn't large enough to be a river.  On some days it hardly flowed
enough to be called running water, but generally they could use it to
splash around in the naturally formed hole at the base of the falls.
This day the water ran heavily enough to be heard from a fair
distance; Thunder knew by its sound the water would be deep and
refreshing.</p>

<p>He walked ahead to the pool and suddenly thought to turn around
before he got in.  Scout wasn't with him.</p>

<p>Thunder retraced his steps and found Scout laying in a sort of
fetal position, completely unconscious, completely unresponsive.
Some hint of a movie came back to Thunder's mind, <em>must be kept
awake or something something coma.</em></p>

<p>"Oh no.  Scout!  Scout! Wake up, Scout!  You have to wake up!"
Thunder pushed Scout over onto his back, but he still didn't
respond.  "Scout!  Scout, come on man, wake up!  You have to wake up,
Scout!"</p>

<p>Thunder ran to the river and looked for some way to carry water
back.  Why had he left his canteen back at the log?</p>

<p>Every idea crossed Thunder's brain at once in a traffic jam.
Splashing the water back to Scout, carrying some in a leaf, carrying
some in his paws.  Ah; his fur.  Thunder lept into the pool then back
out again as quickly as he could and ran back to Scout and stood over
him and shook his body in his best soggy shaggy dog impression.  He
wringed his ear over Scout's face.  That did it.  Scout sputtered at
the spattering of water and coughed a bit.</p>

<p>"Scout!  Scout!!"  Thunder wringed the water from his other ear
onto Scout's face.  "Scout!  Wake Up Scout!"</p>

<p>"what time is it?"</p>

<p>Oh thank God.  "Scout!  It's Five O Clock!  You're late!  Wake
up!!"</p>

<p>"It's 5?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Wake up!  You have to wake up now!"</p>

<p>Scout began to get up.</p>

<p>"Quick Scout!  Come with me."</p>

<p>Thunder took him by the hand this time and led Scout as quickly as
he thought Scout could walk in his dazed state.  At the river, Thunder
decided not to push Scout in, but jumped in again himself.  He
thrashed as much water as he could up at Scout.</p>

<p>"Hey. Thunder.  What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"You've got to stay *awake*!  I'm waking you up!"</p>

<p>"I am awake."</p>  

<p>"Get into the water.  Carefully."  Thunder wondered at the horrible
ironic possibility of Scout dashing his head on the rocks diving into
the water.  What a nightmare that would be.  "Can you swim?  Er, are
you okay to swim right now?"</p>

<p>"I'm okay now."</p>

<p>"Good; get in."</p>

<p>"No; I'll be alright.  Really."</p>

<p>Thunder sighed, "okay."  He nodded after a pause. "Okay.  I'll
trust that you are okay."  He splashed his friend again.</p>

<p>"Hey!"</p>

<p>"Just making sure, buddy."</p>
