<h1 align=center>Eclipse</h1>


<p>
Scout Seven raced around the monolith behind which Thunder Rabbit had
just scampered.  "You're not as fast as you think, Rabbit!" Scout yelled
to his dearest friend.  
<p>
"Oh yeah??"  Thunder stepped on it, so to speak, and added an extra 30
feet between him and Scout.  "*Now* who's fastest, you clunky alien??"
<p>
"That does it, Thunder!"  Scout wasn't *quite* as physically adept as
Thunder, but he could beat him in chess.  "Bishop to Queen two!  Check!"
<p>
Thunder bounded up the rocky hill to the smooth marble floor that had
been laid thousands of years before.  This surface was their holy
ground, eternal, silent, yet somewhat more comforting than one might
imagine a marble floor could be.  Plus it offered a great view of their
forest. The most unusual aspect of The Ground, as they called it, was
that the arrangement of tiles made a chessboard, each cut precisely
square, approximately four feet on a side.  When they discovered it some
8 years ago, Thunder had taught Scout how to play chess, using
themselves and various logs 
as the pieces.  Now they played games continuously in their minds,
sometimes acting out the more interesting games on The Ground.
<p>
Right now, however, Thunder was more interested in winning their
obstacle course race.  He had done 28 of 50 pushups before Scout had
even made it up the hill.  "Bishop to Queen two?"  Suddenly his eyes
widened.  "Bishop to Queen two!  Good move, Scout."
<p>
Scout had done 15 pushups by the time Thunder started the situps. "Hey
Thunder?"
<p>
"I'm thinking!" he puffed.
<p>
"Thunder!  Come look at the tile where you should have put your rook."
<p>
Scout had stopped his pushups and was examining the floor.
<p>
"You're serious."  Thunder sat up.
<p>
"Yeah- come check this out.  There's a crack between these two tiles."
<p>
Over the years, Thunder and Scout had played, wrestled, fought, danced,
screamed, laughed, belched, camped, and done just about any other
activity imaginable on The Ground, the makers of which they never knew.
They did know, however, that there were no cracks between the tiles.
<p>
"A crack?  What?!?"
<p>
"A crack..it's not very wide, but.." Scout looked around at the 
horizon.  "Thunder?  What time is it?"
<p>
"Lunchtime."  Thunder suddenly noted the sky was much darker than it
should be during lunch.
<p>
They looked toward the sun, which appeared quite normal.  Thunder 
accidentally looked <b>at</b> the sun.
<p>
"Ow!"  Thunder squeezed his eyes shut.  "Hey- it's an eclipse."
<p>
"How do you know?"
<p>
"The spot I see when I close my eyes is a crecent shape."
<p>
"Cool."
<p>
Thunder jerked his head back toward the tile.  "Did you hear that?"
<p>
"No, but I felt it."  Scout had lept from the tile, which now sat 
imperceptively lower than its neighbors.  "The tile moved."
<p>
"So did you," Thunder grinned.
<p>
As the sky grew darker, the forest animals tucked themselves into bed,
and the tile stealthily whispered its way below the others. Scout and
Thunder watched in stunned amazement.
<p>
"I *told* you there had to be something under this hill!" they 
exclaimed in unison.
<p>
The tile had lowered fully five inches before the umbral shadow raced
across the plain toward them.  The shadow captured the hill precisely
when the hole opened, issuing a faintly salty breath of air.
<p>
"Holy moley, Thunder.  These tiles are six inches thick!"
<p>
"Scout, the heavens have turned black, the world has moved beneath your
feet, and you're measuring tile?"
<p>
"You're the one who had always wondered."
<p>
"Now I'm wondering how long a full eclipse lasts."
<p>
"On Earth, never more than 7 minutes, why?"
<p>
"Scout.  The hole opened precisely as the umbra reached The Ground. and
I bet it will close precisely as the umbra leaves.  That gives us maybe
3 minutes until this tile is fully opened."
<p>
"I'm with you."
<p>
"So *obviously* that means we have like 30 seconds to decide if..."
<p>
"No, I'm *with* you," Scout interrupted.  "I'm going in with you."
<p>
At the same moment, Scout and Thunder looked up from the hole into each
other's eyes.  Years of growing, living, learning, playing filled their
minds as they recognized that within the next 3 minutes their lives may
change forever.
