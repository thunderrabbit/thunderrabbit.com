<p>The carrot stood nearly 25 meters tall, attached securely to the
wall with (building techniques Scout learned on Eta Carinae)? under
the assumption that the carrot would actually work.</p>

<p>As he approached the site, Thunder couldn't believe the sight, save
for one detail; it was really there.  That was not to be doubted.  Or
else this was the most elaborate hoax Scout had ever successfully
pulled off.</p>

<p>"Heya, buddy!  Ya like it?"  Scout threw his arm around the
Rabbit's shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ub, it's um. it's <em>amazing</em>.  Where, uh wh, how did, where
did it make it, um, get it?"</p>

<p>"Hey there, you've stopped making sense, but I know what you're
asking.  I made it!  Or rather, I built it out of foam and carrot
colored paint.  And some 2x4s to give it structural support.  It took
longer to plan it than to actually make it, but I figured we might as
well make it, well, right, right?"</p>

<p>"Um, right, what.  Wait, you <em>made</em> it???"</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's not a real carrot, Thunder Buns; it's just styrofoam!
With carrot colored paint, like I said.  Sorry to disappoint you, ol
buddy; it's just a huge fake carrot."</p>

<p>"It's <em>not</em> real?" queried Thunder.  And then by way of
clarification, "It's not <em>real</em>?"</p>

<p>"Nope; it's a really big fake carrot.  It's real tall, and real
styrofoam, but it's not real carrot.  But it was made with real care,
in hopes that you would come back safely."</p>

<p>"Oh Scout, I *love* it!  Can I climb it?"</p>

<p>"I <em>knew</em> you'd want to; it should be sturdy enough -"</p>

<p>Thunder knew Scout would have known, and before Scout knew it,
Thunder was scampering his way up the carrot, clawing into the soft
styrofoam, which made for easy climbing.</p>

<p>"This thing is great!"  Thunder called from the top.  "Thanks,
Scout!"</p>

<p>"You're welcome!"</p>

<p>Scout knew better than to say, "be careful," or some such other
nonsense.  Thunder had the balance of a squirrel and enough smarts to
know his limits, which weren't many.</p>

<p>He trusted Scout's ability to make a quality carrot, and knew if
the carrot would not fall, he would not fall right along with it.</p>


<p>The carrot, being shaped generally like a carrot, didn't afford
many places to hide onor explore.  It waas a great carrot, but it was
only that; a carrot.</p>

<p>"Hey Scout?" called Thunder from his perch.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"  Scout appeared to be reading a book but was actually
counting and analyzing individual letters to see if the author
intended some hidden code to be delivered in the guise of a book.
This book didn't seem  to be promisng much in the way of secret
codes, but Scout was pretty patient.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be cool if this were a real carrot?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," Scout guessed, guessing that it would be more cool
for Thunder than it would be for himself.  "Why?"</p>

<p>"Just wondering."  "Well, thinking."  Well, I  was wondering about
the attachment her and well, how strong it was, and if it would be
strong enough to </p>
