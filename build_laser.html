<center><h3>How to build a laser with a tin can and a pices of grass</h3></center>

<p>
A few days ago, Scout and I were watching MacGyver, the episode where
he built a laser using a truck battery, some mirrors, a light bulb,
chicken wire, and a ruby.  Scout and I were not impressed.  We had
already made an entire laser guided missile with that much stuff!

<p>
Scout said, "I could build a laser only using a D-cell battery, 1
mirror, a light bulb, and a piece of glass."  I pretended to be not
impressed.  Without thinking, I said, "I could build a laser out of a
tin can and a piece of <em>grass</em>."

<p>
Scout was impressed.  "Oh really?" he chimed.  I'd like to see this.

<p>
<em>"Me too,"</em> I thought, but I couldn't back down!  "No problem,
Scout!  It's easy.  Just give me about an hour to get it ready."

<p>
Scout put on his jacket, "I'll give you all day.  See you tonight."
and he left.

<p>
Yikes!  What a delimma...  I sat at my drawing board to sketch out a
few ideas.  At first I decided I would just melt the lid of the can
and reshape it into a dlanger nozzle, thereby reducing the problem to
a trivial task of making the grass act as a semi-conductor across the
looped hemispheres, but that was too easy; Scout would certainly not
be impressed with that.

<p>
So I decided to do it the old fashioned way my grandfather had showed
me.  With my pocket knife, I cut off one end of the can and cut a hole
out of the center of it, making a ring shape and a small metal disc.

<p>
Then, with my pocket knife, I sliced the blade of grass into several
thousand thin strands and used the grass juice to glue them across the
hole in the metal ring.  I lined them up perfectly to make a light
polarizing filter.


<p>
I cut out one side of the can, polished the concave portion using a
bit of leftover grass and shaped it into a parabolic mirror.  I placed
this mirror inside the can so that light coming through the hole in
one end would be focused out through the hole in the side.

<p>
But I'll be durned if the light was focused only at a single point and
not into a beam!

<p>
Then I remembered that I had cut out the little disk from the center
of one end of the can!  This I polished and shaped into a hyperbolic
mirror, which would realign the light to a perfect laser beam, if I
could get it suspended inside the can just right.

<p>
I pulled the light polarizing filter and the parabolic mirror out so I
wouldn't damage them while I cut two thin strips out of the bottom end
of the can.  These I would use to support the little hyperbolic mirror
in the middle of the can.

<p>
So I put the parabolic mirror in the bottom so it would direct the
light to a focus right in the center of the can by the hole I had cut
in the side.  I used the two strips to support the hyperbolic mirror
so it would redirect the focused light as a beam right out the side of
the can!

<p>
I put the polarizing filter on top and presto!  I built a laser using
only a piece of grass and a tin can.

<p>
Well, yes, I did use the sun as my light source, but Scout Seven was
still impressed.
