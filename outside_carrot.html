<title>Outside the Burrow</title>


<p>
[Outside, the ground is white, as if a perfect snow has gently fallen.  Yet something seems strange about it.

<p>
At first you notice that none of the trees have snow on their branches, and, in fact, nothing appears snow-covered except the
ground.  Then you think <em>"wait-a-minute...  it's warm outside!  This <b>couldn't</b> be snow!  Hmmm.."</em>

<p>
As you step out onto this mysterious ground surface, you notice its odd springy texture.  It's kinda like walking on a feather
mattress, but a bit bouncier.  You reach down to feel the surface, but your hand seems to pass right through it.  You notice
your feet are slightly hidden in a light fog, which is otherwise invisible against the white ground.]

<p>
"Hey There!!"

<p>
[You look up suddenly to see who is yelling.  Across the white field is a Rabbit, standing about 6 feet tall, waving happily
toward you.  Then, even more bizzare, you see an enormous carrot laying partially buried in the whiteness behind him.]
